- [ ] Provide a host-side library for communicating with the Due running GPIO_Platform (probably in python)
- [ ] Should be more easily possible to count timer ticks in a time period (e.g., some airflow sensors output their throughput in ticks)
- [ ] Ability to sample I2C/SPI sources
- [ ] **pattern_new** command to support uploading patterns into the running Due from the host
- [ ] Servo-handling?

- [ ] A watchdog timer to automatically reset the Due if the code crashes would be useful
- [ ] Investigate if oversampling is a useful filter

- [ ] Use more C++ features for structuring code instead of C style
- [ ] Clean up the code, improve error handling, the usual
